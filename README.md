# Weekend Project - Amazon Homepage Clone + JavaScript Exercises

This repository contains my weekend project, which involves recreating the Amazon homepage based on a provided mockup using HTML and CSS. Additionally, it includes a set of JavaScript exercises, kept separate from the HTML page, to practice JavaScript concepts and problem-solving.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: An HTML page that replicates the Amazon homepage based on the given mockup.
- **style.css**: The associated CSS stylesheet, defining all styles needed to closely match the layout and design of the mockup.
- **D5.js**: A separate file containing various JavaScript exercises. These exercises are independent of the HTML page and serve as standalone practice to strengthen JavaScript skills.

## Implementation Details

### HTML and CSS
- The HTML file structures the Amazon homepage layout according to the mockup design.
- The CSS file provides styles to accurately reproduce the mockupâ€™s appearance, including color schemes, fonts, margins, padding, and positioning for all primary page elements.

### JavaScript Exercises
- The `exercises.js` file contains exercises covering a range of JavaScript topics (e.g., array manipulation, functions, conditions, and loops).
- Each exercise was completed per instructions and tested in a JavaScript environment.

## How to View the Page

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the HTML and CSS Amazon homepage.
3. For JavaScript exercises, open `exercises.js` in a JavaScript environment or in a browser console to run and observe the results.
